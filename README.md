# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction

The Salifort project aimed to analyze employee data and build a predictive model to determine whether an employee will leave the company. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and correlations, and engineering relevant features. Findings indicated that employees are leaving the company due to poor management, longer working hours, numerous projects, and generally lower satisfaction levels. It can be ungratifying to work long hours without receiving promotions or good evaluation scores, leading to burnout. Additionally, it appears that employees with more than six years at the company tend not to leave.

Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models were built. The logistic regression model achieved a precision of 80%, recall of 83%, F1 score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83% on the test set. The decision tree model achieved an AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, F1 score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2% on the test set. The random forest model modestly outperformed the decision tree model.

For future work, building a K-means model on this data and analyzing the clusters may yield valuable insights.
